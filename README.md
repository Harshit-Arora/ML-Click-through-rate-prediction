# ML-Click-through-rate-prediction
Classification Project on a dataset of 32M rows using models such as Decision Trees, Logisitic Regression, Random Forests, Neural Nets and XGBoost

## Introduction:
Online advertising is a form of marketing which delivers promotional messages to consumers via the Internet. Due to the volume of advertisements being published & huge cost associated with marketing campaigns, serving the right advertisement to the right consumer is extremely important. Hence, the ability to predict whether a consumer will click an advertisement on a search engine such as Google will help the firm determine the right advertisement to serve the right consumer. Our project intends to unravel this prediction by creating a classification model, utilizing data of 9 days (Oct 21st - 29th 2014) during which more than 30 million instances of advertisements were served to various consumers.

### Models implemented:
We built and implemented models using the following algorithms:

##### Logistic regression (With Lasso & Ridge Regularization)
##### Decision Trees
##### Random Forest
##### XGBoost


### The Final Model, with a logloss of 0.39 on the test data, was submitted and won 3rd place in a class competition of 11 teams.
